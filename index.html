            MD is an adult that writes poems. His poems have been anthologized in 
            <a href="https://spectrapoets.org/SHOP" target="_blank">Spectra</a>. 
            He wrote and published a poetry book with the homies, 
            <a href="https://l4spress.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Love For Sale</a>, 
            in 2023 but it's out of print. Right now, he's writing more books but he's not finished yet, 
            when he is, you'll most likely be able to find them here, for sale. 
            He designs, typesets, and copyedits books for other writers when he's interested and has the time,
            if you think your book is interesting, <a href="mailto:mdisalways@gmail.com">email</a> him.
            He's an editor at <a href="https://softunion.online/" target="_blank">Soft Union</a>. 
            He also used to edit <a href="https://www.swampspit.com/" target="_blank">Swamp</a>. 
            When he handwrites, he uses all caps. 
            When he poops, he takes at least one leg out of his pants, sometimes removing his pants entirely. 
            When he pees, he utilizes the zip-fly, but he used to unbutton his pants all the way, 
            until somewhat recently, though he never dropped trou all the way, except maybe when he was a young boy. 
            He exclusively wears baggy pants with a zip-fly, this makes going to the bathroom much easier for him. 
            When he skates, his trucks are loose. 
            When he watches NBA highlights, he often rewinds to replay a
            <a href="https://youtu.be/YaiFXaA15Sw?si=VvzFuWtkEt-29Yb3" target="_blank">play</a>, usually more than once. 
            When he sleeps, he's naked, except when he naps, if and when he naps, he wears a black silk eye mask. 
            When he grows up, he wants to be an amazing father that his child wants to chill with.
